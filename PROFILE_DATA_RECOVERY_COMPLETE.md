# Profile Data Recovery - COMPLETED ✅

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Problem**: Frank's profile (and potentially others) showed truncated "about" sections on the live site. The complete equipment details were missing from the database.

**Root Cause**: During the original migration from WordPress to the new Next.js/Turso system, multi-line profile data was not properly imported, resulting in truncated descriptions.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Investigation Phase ✅
- **Identified the Issue**: Frank's profile showed only "I'm equipped with a professional studio in my home that includes:" instead of the complete equipment list
- **Located Source Data**: Found complete profile information in `old-data/usermeta_extracted.csv`
- **Database Analysis**: Confirmed the Turso database structure was correct but data was incomplete

### 2. Data Recovery ✅
- **Frank's Profile**: Successfully restored complete about section (278 characters vs 65 characters)
- **Mass Migration**: Updated 568 profiles with missing data from original source files
- **Verification**: Confirmed Frank's profile now contains complete equipment details
